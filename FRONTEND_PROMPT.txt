I have a complete production-ready backend API for a Liquor Shop Admin Panel. The backend is running at http://localhost:5000/api and provides all necessary REST endpoints.

Build a Next.js 14 frontend (App Router) that integrates with this backend API. The UI should match the dark-themed admin dashboard design with:

**BACKEND API BASE URL:** http://localhost:5000/api

**REQUIRED PAGES:**
1. Dashboard (/dashboard) - KPI cards, charts (Stock by Category bar chart, Sales Trend area chart, Products by Category donut chart)
2. Products (/products) - Product table with filters (All, Out of Stock, Low Stock, Top Sellers, Most Reviewed, Recommended), search, sort, pagination
3. Orders (/orders) - Orders table with status updates, bill printing
4. Payments (/payments) - Payment table with filters (All, QR Payment, COD), summary cards
5. Analytics (/analytics) - Revenue metrics with growth %, sales trend chart, stock by category chart
6. Stock Alerts (/stock-alerts) - Out of stock, low stock sections with reorder functionality
7. Top Sellers (/top-sellers) - Ranked products list, sales insights cards
8. Recommended (/recommended) - Recommended products table, most recommended sidebar
9. Reviews (/reviews) - Review summary with rating distribution, most reviewed products

**API ENDPOINTS TO INTEGRATE:**

- POST /api/reviews

Notifications:
- GET /api/notifications (query: type, isRead, sortBy, sortOrder, page, limit)
- GET /api/notifications/unread-count
- PUT /api/notifications/:id/read
- PUT /api/notifications/read-all

Export:
- GET /api/export/monthly?year=2024&month=12&type=excel
- GET /api/export/monthly?year=2024&month=12&type=pdf

**API RESPONSE FORMAT:**
All endpoints return: { success: boolean, message: string, data: any, pagination?: { page, limit, total, pages } }

**UI REQUIREMENTS:**
- Dark theme (black/dark gray background, white text, orange accents)
- Left sidebar navigation with all menu items
- Top header with search, "Export Data" button, "+ Add Product" button, notification bell with badge, user profile
- Reusable DataTable component with search, sort, filter, pagination
- KPI cards with growth percentages and icons
- Charts using Recharts or Chart.js
- Status badges (In Stock/Low Stock/Out of Stock - green/yellow/red)
- Modal/Drawer for forms
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Loading states and error handling

**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (already configured)
- React Query (TanStack Query) for server state
- React Hook Form for forms
- Centralized API client (lib/api.ts)
- Authentication context (protect admin routes)
- Real-time notification polling (every 30s)
- Responsive design

**FOLDER STRUCTURE:**
app/ (pages), components/ (reusable components), lib/ (API client, utils), hooks/ (custom hooks), context/ (Auth, Notifications), types/ (TypeScript types)

**KEY FEATURES:**
- Automatic discount calculation (discountPercent → discountAmount, finalPrice)
- Stock status auto-determination (0 = Out, <10 = Low, >=10 = In Stock)
- Real-time notification updates
- Server-side pagination, search, sorting, filtering
- Chart-ready data from analytics endpoints
- Export functionality (Excel/PDF download)

Start building the complete Next.js frontend with all pages, components, and API integrations. Ensure proper error handling, loading states, and user experience.
